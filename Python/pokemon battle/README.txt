This is a little Python program I made to try to imitate the flow of a Pokemon battle. 

Due to lack of time, I haven't finished it but it has basic damagage calculation based on type advantage (Type_Chart.xlsx) and stats (Pokemon_main.xlsx), 
it can decide which pokemon attacks first based on Speed stat and a couple more things.
